# stopwatch-cmd
just a stopwatch written in batch, but now with hours, minutes and seconds.

There is a loop that counts time by adding numbers to a specific value, just as same as the other stopwatches written in Batch. However, two more commands add minutes and hours, making it more advanced. These are how those commands work:
  - When the second reaches 60, it will be reset, then the minute will be added.
  - When the minute reaches 60, it will be reset, then the hour will be added.
And when the hour reaches 24, the entire stopwatch will be reset.
